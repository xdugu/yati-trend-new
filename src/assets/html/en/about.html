Yati-Trend clothes are designed to infuse African with European Fashion.<br><br>
My husband, Yayra is from Ghana where wearing colourful and patterned garments are very
fashionable. Our designs are made to fuse the african flare and color into european clothing
The aim with the clothes we design is to encourage people to be more open to wearing 
coloured and patterned clothes which shows uniqueness and confidence. African clothes bring joy 
to everyday life and guarantees that its owner will always be unique as it is not a usual costume.
<br><br>

In addition to colours and patterns we also find elegance and comfort very important, so we 
strive to design our clothes so that everyone can enjoy it. Besides, we make sure that all 
garments are made of quality fabrics that are gentle to the skin and wearable in the long run. 
African materials are made from 100% cotton and the fabrics we combine them with are mostly made 
of cotton as well.<br><br>

We hope you will find clothes in our collection that you would love to wear.<br><br>
