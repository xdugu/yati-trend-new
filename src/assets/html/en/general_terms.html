consumer for the payments he has made, including the shipping charge. The service provider does not have to repay the obligation until the product is returned or until 
the consumer has not received a credible certificate of return of the product. In the event of a discrepancy between the two dates, the operator must take account of 
the earlier date.<br><br>

<b>7.3</b> For packages that are sent back within 14 days the send-back cost is on on Yati-Trend, unless the item purchased was on sale or bought with a coupon code. 
In this case the buyer is responsible for the send-back cost.<br><br>

of the product, as the Consumer is liable for any damage resulting from its misuse.<br>

misunderstandings later (for example, the product returned was damaged or incomplete).<br><br>

<li>in the case of a sealed product which cannot be returned for health or hygiene reasons after it has been opened after delivery</li>

fax notification takes into account the time of sending the email or fax.<br><br>

In the event of withdrawal, the Consumer shall return the ordered product to the Service Provider's address without delay, but no later than 14 days from the date of 
notification of the cancellation. The deadline is considered to be met if you send the product before the 14-day deadline. The customer shall bear the costs of 
returning the goods due to the exercise of the right of withdrawal.<br><br>

However, the Service Provider shall not be obliged to reimburse the Consumer for the additional costs arising from the choice of mode of transport other than the 
cheapest conventional mode offered by the Service Provider. The Consumer shall exercise his right of withdrawal between the date of conclusion of the contract and the 
date of receipt of the product.<br>
